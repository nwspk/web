    %h2 Tutoring
  %p Each fellowship candidate is assigned a member of the faculty as a tutor. Meetings with tutors should happen once a month and be an hour long. The responsibility of the tutor is to provide guidance and mentorship as the tutee navigates the intricacies of their time at Newspeak House. This is a demanding course, and these monthly check-ins provide an opportunity for personalised guidance and goal-setting, and help to ensure that any challenges are addressed early on.

%details
  %summary
    %h2 Pairwork
  %p All members of the cohort must do a pairwork session with every other member each month, lasting at least one hour. These must be in person, with exactly two people, no more or less. This time should be used to work together on a module of your choosing, core or advanced. Notes should be kept on what was achieved at each session.

    %h2 Core Modules
  %p Core modules are mandatory activities that all students participate in throughout the year, and are taught in collaboration by the entire faculty.

  %h3 Governance
  %p Through managing a set of common pool resources, students have the chance to experiment with and experience different forms of governance, and develop original systems for decision-making, policy development, resource allocation, and conflict resolution.
  %a.section-link{:href => "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CyYVuxR0cOZTWA8gEXsfswke0sYRMSEv6MtqJwa-Hm8", :target=> "_blank"} Module Guide

  %h3 Fieldwork
  %p Students will engage with a broad variety of emerging civic communities of practice and understanding how they work. Students will also familiarise themselves with the landscape of political technologies through exploring the library and undertaking a grantmaking exercise.

  %h3 Prototype
  %p The culmination of the year’s work as students produce an original contribution to the field of political technology, both to demonstrate their sophisticated understanding of the field and to have a lasting real world impact.

    %h2 Advanced Modules
  %p Advanced modules, led by a single faculty member, focus on more specific skills and understanding.

  %h3 Institution, Human, Technology
  %div.profile-subtitle Dr Six Silberman
  %p This module explores the complex interplay between institutions and organisations; humans; and technologies.
  %p We will explore how organisations and institutions act, change, and relate to individuals, while reflecting on what makes them work well, what causes them to fail, and how we can sustain healthy relationships with them.
  %a.section-link{:href => "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rq1aTkoIyzToYhVnQuD0H9B51cXjkMVtIKKiKJRz_VA", :target=> "_blank"} Module Guide

  %h3 Political Organising
  %div.profile-subtitle Hannah O’Rourke
  %p As technology reshapes the political landscape, traditional wisdom in political strategy is being upended. This offers huge opportunities for campaigners and political institutions, but also challenges.
  %p In this module, you will learn about the theoretical cutting edge of campaign technology, as well as the current state of political campaigning and organising in the UK.
  %p Alongside this, students will learn how to navigate the realpolitik of the political system and how to make lasting systemic political change.

  %h3 Digital Protocols
  %div.profile-subtitle Theodore Keloglou
  %p Protocols are structured forms of communication that shape the digital world.
  %p In this module, we explore both their technical workings and their social and political impact.

  %h3 Leading Tech Projects
  %div.profile-subtitle Peyman Owladi
  %p This module is about moving beyond prototyping to build tools and apps that are production-grade, widely used, or critical in workflows, while exploring how to adapt practices to keep pace with rapidly accelerating development and AI assistance.
  %p We will share emerging approaches and paradigm shifts to help you focus on what drives projects forward, make smart tech stack choices, and stay agile as standard practices evolve.
  %a.section-link{:href => "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VWIjCx-vn6Q1j4PR_kfYvPhqCcVYvfFRHaaTR7bZoG8", :target=> "_blank"} Module Guide

  %h3 Data Governance
  %div.profile-subtitle Anouk Ruhaak
  %p We have a growing consensus on what we do not want — platform dictatorships, biased automation, exploitative data collection — but far less clarity on what kind of future we should be building instead. Emerging models like trusts, fiduciaries, commons, and cooperatives aim to rebalance power, align incentives with people, widen participation, and share benefits.
  %p As large language models bring new risks of privacy loss, labour displacement, polluted information, invasive agents, and biometric “solutions” to deepfakes, the urgent task is to govern data and AI so that privacy, fairness, and accountability are protected.

  %h3 Rethinking Chat
  %div.profile-subtitle John Evans
  %p How we communicate shapes how we organise, and how we organise shapes how we live; through our systems of communication, we prefigure the world we want to exist.
  %p In this module, we will explore chat as the dominant medium of organisation — from grassroots to state power - examining emerging tools and experiences to imagine where chat might go next in enabling political action.
  %a.section-link{:href => "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dbIvP_4ZJwTbRUluHmgHSmqiGQ61x_aFWFC54tUF4Q0", :target=> "_blank"} Module Guide

  %h3 Open Web Data
  %div.profile-subtitle Hoagy Davis-Digges
  %p Most web projects offer value to their users by offering a way to view and/or interact with some dataset.
  %p This information either has to be provided by users, which presents a cold start problem for many projects, or found in some standardised format so that it can be used… until recently!
  %a.section-link{:href => "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PwxskePp8HRTtEZpbCarSK4Pc_p7xNpVElwcIuOazzs", :target=> "_blank"} Module Guide

  %h3 Protecting Your Users
  %div.profile-subtitle Lewis Westbury
  %p The internet is a hostile environment. Internet-facing applications face a constant stream of threats - ranging from casual scripted attacks through to sophisticated, targeted attacks. Asking users to trust you with their data is a big responsibility.
  %p In this module we’ll explore techniques for reasoning about this environment, and how to build software and systems that are reliable and protect user data.

  %h3 Group Decisionmaking
  %div.profile-subtitle Dr Joshua Becker
  %p There is no such thing as an independent individual: everything you do and know and think is shaped by other people.
  %p The overall framework for this module is one of management as engineering. The goal is to help you think like an engineer about designing team, organizational, and social processes.

  %h3 Collectivity
  %div.profile-subtitle Dr Zarinah Agnew
  %p Coming soon...

  %h3 Network Development
  %div.profile-subtitle James Moulding
  %p This module is for those who want to learn network strategies and field-building by putting them into practice.
  %p Together we will explore how to connect fragmented efforts into stronger ecosystems, compound learning across people and organisations, weave power and resources, sustain leadership and infrastructure beyond individual projects, and use technology to support and grow communities anywhere.

  %h3 Knowledge Production
  %div.profile-subtitle Matt Stempeck
  %p Coming soon...

  %h3 Evidence & Impact
  %div.profile-subtitle Andreas Varotsis
  %p This module asks how we know what really works, exploring how to design experiments and evaluations that meaningfully assess impact in a robust, empirical way.
  %p Beyond evaluation, we will look at how evidence can be turned into action — history is full of well-evidenced interventions that went nowhere — and how you can use evidence not just to test your ideas, but to drive change in the world.
  %a.section-link{:href => "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BNAdJXGarfRpM0GtVvbYlzLJ2I_64GLSPMhVkEbSmd8", :target=> "_blank"} Module Guide

  %h3 Service Design
  %div.profile-subtitle Sinead Doyle
  %p Service Design is the discipline of creating end-to-end experiences that help people meet their needs, whether through products, people, or processes delivered across time and channels. Though not always applied universally or correctly, it has become the mainstream methodology in the public sector.
  %p In this module, we will explore the shift from product to service thinking, examine the tools and methods of the field, identify barriers like procurement hurdles and skills gaps, and consider how service design can evolve to remain relevant in a changing world.

  %h3 Game Design
  %div.profile-subtitle Sam Ballard
  %p Game Design is the discipline of creating systems that deliver specific experiences, drawing on insights from fields such as economics, architecture, ergonomics, and anthropology.
  %p In this module, we will explore games as a kind of tool that trains players to develop strategies to interact with systems, as well as looking at how game mechanics can be applied to understand and address wider systemic challenges.

  %h3 Wargames & Challenge
  %div.profile-subtitle Alex Vince
  %p In a world that is complex, dynamic, and adversarial, these techniques can help us anticipate how others might act and what strategies could succeed. They are also methods of influence that can be used to push people and organisations to change their behaviour and acknowledge problems.
  %p In this module, we will explore both Wargaming and the practice of Reasonable Challenge as tools to sharpen decision-making, counter groupthink, and build resilience—applicable not only to geopolitical conflict but also to organisational and social challenges.
