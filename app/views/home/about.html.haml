%h2 What is Newspeak House?
%p
  Newspeak House, The London College of Political Technology, is an independent residential college founded in 2015. Our mission is to study, nurture and inspire emerging communities of practice across civil society and the public sector in the UK.
%p
  Newspeak House has two core activities; it hosts a busy calendar of 
  = link_to 'events', 'events'
  at its campus in central London, as well as a one year
  = link_to 'residential programme', 'residency'
  for emerging leaders in the field. Those who have graduated from the residential programme - over 80 now - become
  %a{:href => "/fellowship"}> &nbsp;Fellows&nbsp;of&nbsp;Newspeak&nbsp;House
  \, and can be found in significant positions across many prominent institutions.
  
%h2 What is Political Technology?
%p
  Society is made up of an ecosystem of institutions, and the sum of their actions shape the world that we live in. For better or for worse, these actions are deeply influenced by the infrastructures that they choose to use - they determine what is measured, what is decided, and what can be done. What infrastructures lead to what outcomes? How are these choices made, and by whom? How can we create new technologies that lead to the social outcomes that we want?
%p
  Political Technology is the study of institutions founded with a purpose (civic, political, public sector, charitable, activist, etc), the communities that surround them, and in particular the novel digital infrastructures that they produce and deploy. This is a diverse and dynamic field that is affecting society in complex ways. To give an idea of the range and variety of projects, some examples:

  Edward is dean of Newspeak House, responsible for setting its research direction as well as the day-to-day running of the college. His area of study is infrastructure for organising and network development, and he spends his time trying to connect up bits of civil society, or making tools to do so: chair

  Zarinah is a neuroscientist by training. After spending over a decade in academia, they left to study the science of groups of brains - that is, humans in collectivity.
%p
  Alongside their work with the college, Zarinah runs three nonprofits aimed at experimental aspects of society, collective transformation and para-institutions. The  
  %a{:href => "https://www.socialobservatory.space"} Social Science Observatory
  is dedicated to the study of social science in the wild, 
  %a{:href => "https://www.alternativejustices.com/"} Alternative Justices
  works towards abolitionist community-based harm prevention and response, and 
  %a{:href => "https://www.districtcommons.org/"} District Commons
  engineers experimental spaces where humans can ‘be otherwise’. Together, these strands allow both the prefiguration of new social configurations, as well as the study of their transformational potential.
